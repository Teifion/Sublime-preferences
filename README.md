**Fetch settings**  
So far pretty minimal but it might grow one day.

**sh.sublime_build**  
Hit Super + B and it will run the open shell script at it's location.

**Teifion.tmTheme**  
The theme I've used in Textmate since I started using it. I'm not sure where I picked the colours from but I've never been a fan of the darker schemes.
